If you write the yml file in VS code, you can type int o the terminal:
docker-compose up

Once it finishes running the yml file, go open the browser and go to 
localhost:5050

You would then Enter pgAdmin with credentials you wrote in yml file under services:pgAdmin:Environment

NOTE: Make sure you have Docker Desktop open and the Docker extension in VS code.
